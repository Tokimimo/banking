The above postman export is created for testing purposes and can perform all requests this example project is capable of.
Just import the collection into your postman installation and start using the requests.

The only disadvantage is that the authorization token delivered by the system is not automatically extracted and put
in the header of all future requests. At the moment the header needs to be manually copied. ( Due to me wanting to finish
the project fast and not wanting to spend time on researching such a feature of postman )
